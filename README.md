# Scripting and Programming (C867) CPP project


This is my submission of the performance assessment (PA) for scripting and programming in the CS program at WGU.


Essentially you're given data about 4 students + you and you have to create various functions to show specific parts of the data (eg. printing all the invalid emails.)  The final result is a console output showing you did this.


Tips:

* You have to use Visual Studio (the full IDE) or equivalent to build the project. You can't build with just a code editor like VSCode. 

* You can use onlinegdb (https://www.onlinegdb.com) to build it too.

* You have to receive "competent" in *every* category to pass the course, otherwise your submission will get returned. It's not like a traditional rubric where you simply lose points.

* Make sure to take screenshots of the console run and put it in your submission.
